# Tensor-flow_and_image
CS-63 Big Data Analytics Project

Goal:
Demonstrate the technology that can enable artists/painters to apply their imaginative styles from an image to any targeted image, generating a visual art from machine learning technique such as deep learning (hidden/deep convolutional neural network) and utilizing the massive available computing power (AWS GPUs)‚Äù

Visual Art-style transfer: Demonstrate Style Transfer and Color transfer technique for Visual Art generation
Different Optimizer: Compare performances of GradientDescent Optimizer, Adagrad Optimizer, Adadelta Optimizer, Adam Optimizer, RMSProp Optimizer and L-BFGS optimizer in visual art generation

Dataset and Model used: Pre-trained Very deep Convolutional neural network Model of 16(VGG16) and 19(VGG19) layers is used. Dataset is a 82,000 Images taken from COCO Captioning Challenge( http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download)
